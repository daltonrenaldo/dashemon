# some totally fun things to do for the next person:
1. figure out how to update the dashboard#show view in realtime (or, probably more practical, an AJAX request every minute or something)
2. make it not look like a four year old duct taped css together at the last minute
3. style the airbrake and new relic logs.
4. port the html to haml
